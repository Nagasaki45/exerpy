Wikipedia
=========

Using the ``wikipedia`` 3rd party package write a program that ask the user for an entry, it will fetch the page from wikipedia and ask the user again if he want to read a summery or open a random reference in his browser.

Notes
-----

- ``pip install wikipedia``
- ``import webbrowser``
- If the input from the user is ambiguous show the different options to the user and ask again.
- Some [docs](https://wikipedia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/code.html#api)
