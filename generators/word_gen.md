Word generator
==============

Using only generators (functions / expressions) create a program that count the palindromes in [this words list](http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/wordlist/wordsEn.txt). Filter words shorter than 4 letters.

All the computations should be triggered by a single call to ``len``.
